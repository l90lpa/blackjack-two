## folder structure
- src: contains source code files
- include: contains header files
- test: contains the source code files required for unit testing which are dependent on the src and include files.

The 'makefile' works with GNU gcc 4.8 or newer. Semicolons have been used in place of tabs to denote recipes for the targets. As tabs were causing problems when using the makefile on Terminal v2.6.1 on OSX v10.11.13.
